      <p>I was really impressed by the thoughts <a href="https://twitter.com/agolis">Andrew Golis</a> discussed in his blog post <a href="https://blog.this.cm/i-drew-a-bunch-of-dots-to-explain-why-social-media-is-broken-97725e2f0cc4#.fmvttzfvt">‘I drew a bunch of dots to explain why social media is broken’</a>.</p>

<p>Andrew explains how the strategy that many media companies take to promote content on social media are leaving our news feeds homogenous, as well as a little less human. This leaves the content that we consume everyday not as inspiring as it could be.</p>

<p>These problems are attempting to be solved by ‘<a href="https://this.cm/join">This.</a>’, of which Andrew is the founder and CEO.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This. lets users follow publishers (people and companies) you trust, sharing stuff they recommend and/or made. But every member is limited to sharing just 1 link a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That 1 share limit doesn’t just stop this arms race before it starts. It turns every publisher’s share into something even more valuable: a statement of passion. When the publishers you trust make their pick, they’re telling you: “This is what’s worth your time today.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I found This. to be such a refreshing take on consuming content on the web, I thought I would do a teardown of the onboarding process. This is inspired by <a href="http://www.useronboard.com">useronboard.com</a>.</p>

<p>Nice idea to be able to see a glimpse of the final interface to give the user context as they’re signing up.  However, the onboarding windows appears to be part of the main UI – perhaps, dare I say, a drop shadow to add visual depth and contrast would help suggest that the onboarding window is temporary?</p>

<p>It would also be nice to see some example posts in the UI underneath to give the user even more context.</p>

<p>A fairly clear value proposition explaining who will like This.  However, it doesn’t explain why only being able to post ‘just 1 line a day’ is beneficial.</p>

<p>Anyways, I happened to have come from the blog post, lets get started!</p>

<p>Entered my details but noticed there was no guide on what the password should be – the system actually allows a 1 character password.</p>

<p>I’m a supporter of Joel Califa’s <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/patronizing-passwords/">Password Security Guide design pattern</a>, which aims to educate users on using strong passwords, rather than enforcing overly strict password rules on users.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="threethirteen">Three/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Nice value proposition for connecting my Twitter account. Although, would be nice to make the ‘No thanks, I don’t want to connect to Twitter’ option look a bit more clickable – perhaps an underline?</p>

<p>Very good to see that This. are not asking for all permissions under the sun, just the ones necessary to validate your account and see your followers.</p>

<h2 id="fivethirteen">Five/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Beam me up, Scotty!</p>

<h2 id="sixthirteen">Six/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Not sure why the copy for this stage is the same as step three. I’ve already connected to Twitter so surely the copy should be more along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Here are the folks on Twitter you know. Follow them to see what they’re sharing.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, tried clicking the three dots which are normally interactive and indicate a carousel. This isn’t the design pattern here. The three dots show what stage of the onboarding process we’re at. This would be a lot less confusing if it was more clearly a progress indicator.</p>

<h2 id="seventhirteen">Seven/Thirteen</h2>

<p>I decided to follow them all. Let’s continue!</p>

<p>Great value proposition again. Lets see who else we can follow.</p>

<div class="blog__img--lg">

<h2 id="ninethirteen">Nine/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Uh oh!  Looks like this page doesn’t have any more content when I scroll even though I can see the top of the next user in the list.</p>

<div class="blog__img--lg">
  <img src="https://ingledow-2016.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/img/2016/01/14/this-onboard/10.jpg

</div>

<h2 id="tenthirteen">Ten/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Value proposition is clear and keeps the tone of voice consistent with the ‘rad’, ‘cool’, ‘dude’, ‘bro’ vibe This. have got going here.</p>

<p>Downside, this page has the same issue as step nine – the content is missing when I scroll.</p>

<div class="blog__img--lg">
  <img src="https://ingledow-2016.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/img/2016/01/14/this-onboard/11.jpg

<h2 id="eleventhirteen">Eleven/Thirteen</h2>

<p>Not quite sure on the need for calling what is effectively my ‘profile’, a ‘shelf’. Anyways, the copy makes it fairly clear that this is where all my published links will be shown. It may be helpful to explain that ‘my shelf’ can be seen at <a href="https://this.cm/dingledow">this.cm/dingledow</a> on this page.</p>

<p>Not sure why I need to upload an avatar or enter my Twitter username when I’ve already used Twitter to authenticate and sign up. This. should already be able access this information.</p>

<p>Uploaded and added the information manually.</p>

<p>Boom! Here’s to what should be a more valuable, less homogenous feed of content!</p>
