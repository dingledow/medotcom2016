Every year, the Northumbria School of Design exhibit students' work at the [REVEAL show](http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/sd/academic/scd/whatson/news/reveal2012). It is a chance for the public, but more importantly, potential employers to view graduate's final work for the year. They also exhibit the work at the [D&AD 'New Blood'](https://www.dandad.org/awards/new-blood) show in London, which is held in the Old Spitalfields Market.

Given that this is one of the best chances that graduates of Northumbria's School of Design get to show off their work, it is obviously really important to make an impact. That is what the Graphic Design year group of 2012 have certainly done!

They really wanted to show their work off to prospective employers, so they focussed on the word 'show' and developed their own circus brand for the exhibition. However, since D&AD New Blood exhibits work from all over the country, they needed something to strengthen their identity and make themselves memorable. This led to their final brand being heavily influenced by the thing that has all influenced their lives in Newcastle â€“ the Geordie dialect.
